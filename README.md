# Symbolic Programming, Trinity College Dublin

## Information
This repository is intended to be a compilation of past assignments and past paper solutions for the module "Symbolic Programming" at Trinity College Dublin.


## Disclaimer
I am not good at Prolog. Some answers I do not know, and some answers won't get full marks. It should state this in the code comments if this is the case. Please, feel free to contribute to this repository as I built up the collection of past paper solutions, I will need the help.
